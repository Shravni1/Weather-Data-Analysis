# Weather Data Analysis Dashboard
This is my task during the internship at Nexus, where I undertook the development of an interactive and insightful weather analysis dashboard.

In this project, I used various visualizations to forecast rainfall for the next day based on today's analysis. Bar charts were utilized to illustrate the relationships and averages of minimum and maximum temperatures, rainfall, and sunshine factors. Additionally, scatter plots were used to highlight correlations between different weather variables such as minimum pressure and maximum humidity.
Moreover, pie charts were used to portray the distribution of rainy days and their relationship with wind gust speed and pressure. A timeline chart was incorporated to showcase temporal patterns and trends, providing insights into how factors like pressure, humidity, and temperature from today's analysis may predict changes in the rainy season for tomorrow
